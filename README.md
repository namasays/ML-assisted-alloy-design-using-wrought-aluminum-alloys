## Overview

This repository features Python code to perform **predictive modeling**, **feature analysis**, and **validation** of machine learning models, using datasets focused on wrought aluminum alloys. The project demonstrates the potential of ML techniques like **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR**, and **ANN**, combined with advanced feature engineering and statistical validation, to enhance alloy design.

Key highlights include:
- Achieved an **8% improvement in prediction accuracy** (RÂ² from 0.9 to 0.97) through hyperparameter tuning and advanced feature engineering.
- Expanded dataset size and improved model robustness using web scraping techniques (**BeautifulSoup, Selenium**).
- Validated model performance using **cross-validation**, **random seed testing**, and statistical methods (**t-tests**), with actionable insights from **feature importance analysis**.
